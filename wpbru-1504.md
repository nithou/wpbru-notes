## Podcasting : The in & outs

By : Gracious Gilbert & Courteous Chris

### Recording & Editing

- Microphone (Very Important)
- Pop Guard (prevent the "p" sound problem)
- A modern computer (or a Mac)
- Audio Editing Software (Audacity or Garageband + How To)
- Website (so people can retrieve links / show notes you talk about and things like that)

Usually you can stay at 128kbps for the MP3 of your podcast, which is way suffisant for the usual podcasts.

If you want, you can record Skype sessions by using Call Recorder or Pamela (sharewares).

#### Optional Stuff

- Audio Mixer (fade in, fade out, ... while live)
- Jingles and/or Music (you can use [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/) to find some music at less cost)
- Video (Google Hangouts is quite good at doing that)

### The WordPress side

[Blubrry PowerPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/)

When you upload the file, it automatically detects a lot of things (size,duration, ...) and give you an audio player to put your podcast into your website (by using a simple shortcode). It also gives you interesting basic statistics (there's a pro version).

(You shouldn't post large files on your own, you can use things like [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/), Amazon Cloud, ...).

-- In the website, Gilbert powered his website using WordPress Custom Fields

Try to have a strong naming convention & don't forget the blog post by episode (not absolutely necessary but nice to have).

You can also enter your iTunes credentials into Blubrry, so that it will automatically sends your podcast to iTunes every time you publish a new one on your website, Blubrry does all the work for you :)

### Interviewing or Recording

- Familiar Show Structure : stay logical in the way you organize your podcast (intro, ...). Get to the content as fast as you can.

- Making use of Feebdack : get over your ego, don't be affraid of what other people might think

- Types of Questions : don't hesitate to do some pre interview, to warm up and ease things a little bit. Explain your interviewee the environment, ... Make the people as relax as possible, bring energy to your conversation (be prepared to be the war horse, you are the one putting the energy in your podcast).

A nice app : [Stitcher](http://www.stitcher.com/)

Rule of thumb : Edit as little as possible ;)

### Organizing yourself

- Schedule your podcast : stay on a regular basis, think about recording some podcast in advance, so you're prepared to face anything (avoid talking about things to come like Christmas in the podcast as you're never sure when you'll air it).

- Finding Interviewees : Chris has a 60% responds on his interviewee, so don't rely on one single person.

- Finding Topics : find your subject, and stick with it.

- Making use of Templates : keep standards e-mail, templates, ... to save you time when searching someone to interview, ...

- Software : Evernote & Trello (Project Management software)
