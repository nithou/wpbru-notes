## WordPress as team communication tool (Ruben)

WordPress has **evolved** from blogging system to full website (community, communication, ...).

Using [P2](http://p2theme.com/), you can have a private communication website, quite useful for teams. It provides a clean & simple system to communicate, a bit Twitter-like. It also provides an e-mail notification tool.

Cleaned the mailbox usage by 1/3, so quite useful. It provides a place to share less important stuffs, inspiration, links, ...

Automattic use it internally : [reference](http://ma.tt/2009/05/how-p2-changed-automattic/)
A new version is coming, [called 02](http://www.slideshare.net/beaulebens/o2-wcsf2013). (it's [available here](http://geto2.com/))

**Downside** : P2 theme conflicts a lot with other plugins.

## Sell Media Presentation (Eric)

Quite all-in-one plugin, but hard to modify as it seems oriented towards *simple users*.

Allow you to specify a lot of parameters, variations of a single product.

Integrate a Paypal and an e-mail system. Allows you to bluk upload items and set parameters.

Product is free but you have to pay for the support.

It's [available here](http://graphpaperpress.com/plugins/sell-media/)
