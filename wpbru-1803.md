URL : [Themosis Website](http://www.themosis.com)
Twitter : [Follow Themosis](http://www.twitter.com/themosis)

Created by [Julien Lamb√©](http://www.jlambe.be), web & ui designer, web developer.

Features : APIs, modern php features, composer ready & Wordpress & MVC.

Themosis is not the first attempt in the WordPress framework "market". But, unlike the rest, Themosis isn't based on an administration page in the WordPress settings, it's meant only for developers, preventing structure changes or damages by potential developer's clients.

Themosis is a suite : it comes with 1 plugin & 1 theme. 

### The Plugin

It contains the core classes & libraries of the Framework. It's where you configure everything and how your WordPress will behave.

### The Theme

It's the "public" part of your application (assets, images, fonts, ...).

### Demo

-- (see the building of the website during the demo, unfortunately not recorded, this will teach you to not miss those wonderful meet up :D)

### Conclusion

Early access for the WordPress Meetup group [here](http://www.themosis.com/beta) (with documentation).

The framework will be free and open source as soon as it's released. (The bookstore example website will be put on Github next week).
