**Social networks log-in** (65% dropout on usual checkout due to too many informations to fill in). For payements **up to 25â‚¬** (not more). Virtual wallet. 

Transaction fee when you put the money (only user), so the merchants don't have to pay to use the service, **the final users does**. The transaction is **anonymous** (merchant doesn't have the informations of the end user).

You can generate 5x more revenue when the payment is **frictionless** & **small** (hinder engagement). 

If the user already owns an account (and this one is topped up), the transaction is done **immediately** once the user log in on a social network.

The system works but not yet widely use and shall become usable very soon. 

It is extremely usable, provides a lot of flexibility (staircase model, 1 week free then pay, ...). It provides also a **Wordpress Plugin** (allows a by article setting).

## SEO and Keyword Research

**Speaker** : @chrissmit (christ@InternetBusinessQuestions.com)

Google owns 73% of the Search market (for the USA), it's bigger in Belgium (80-90%). 

Google use **multiple parameters** to rank a site :
- Server location
- Domain age
- Domain history
- Domain keywords, on page keywords
- Number of times keyword is used
- % of keyword to page words
- Back-links
- Keywords in those back-links
- Keywords associated with your chosen keyword
- Number of pages
- etc 

Google **is not objective**, it learns by user. To make it objective : log out from everything (or use the incognito, private browsing), or even change computer.

### Keywords

How do you want **to be found** ? How to **pick the right keyword** ? 

Long tail keywords tends to have a **higher conversion rate** (but have a smaller search volume) : "Real Estate" (small keyword) > "Queen Anne Seattle Real Estate" (long tail keyword).

Different tools allows you to build your keywords :

- **Google Keyword Planner** : meant for advertising, give an exact monthly match.
- **Long Tail Pro** : 97$ one time fee (3 licenses). Analyse the competitors, displays the Page Authority, the title, ...
- **Market Samurai** : gives more details but slower but allow to have a weekly ranking overview.
- ...

*Page Rank* has been deprecated for **Page Authority**, defined by [Moz](http://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority) (the lower, the better (less paid), a P.A. around 25-30 is the best "value").

### Backlinks

**D.I.Y.**, don't buy them (penalised by Google), use Article Directories, social web, YouTube, Google Places, Forums, Comments, RSS feeds (and directory), ... Be **consistent**, use either www.mysite.com or mysite.com (not if you link them into **Google Webmasters**).

### Adding your site to search engines

Use Google Webmaster Tools, Bing Submit Tool, Yahoo submitting tool, [dmoz.org](http://www.dmoz.org/) (high quality backlinck, but manual and if done correctly), ... Receiving a link from an *.edu website gives a big impact on your ranking (academical).

[MajesticSEO.com](http://www.majesticseo.com/) : gives an overview of your back-link profile ([ahrefs.com](http://ahrefs.com) does the same).

Don't abuse of the keywords, too much use of the keyword will damage your website.

### SocialFlow

[SocialFlow](http://www.socialflow.com/solutions) provides a lot of tools concerning the social medias that help building your audience.

## Website Critic

- Why not provide an **image above the fold** ? (as there's a lot of content)
- The menu is **taking a lot of space**, would it be possible to reduce it ?
- Perhaps a button on the sidebar linking to the Amazon Marketplace would provide a better **call to action**, more direct and clear
- Replace the **links with images-buttons CTA** ? (Apple links, Amazon, ...). Some plugins can do this pretty well :) (or you can simply use the marketplace button generators).

- The **3 bars / Hamburger** menu becomes recognized as a symbol for menu, why not using it ? Avoid hiding the major part of your navigation :)
- Increase the **thumbnail size**, at the actual size you can't see before clicking on it.
