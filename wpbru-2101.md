## Presentation of Easy Digital Download (plugin)

Free plugin made by Pippin Williamson and [available here](http://easydigitaldownloads.com). Easy installation and post-like administration to add downloads.

It allows to set a fix and a variable price (in case of different rights for a photography for example). It also allows to develop bundles. It uploads all the protected files to a special protected folder, giving some protection to the files. 

The plugin allows you to limit the number of downloaded files. The plugin handles all the check-out process pages (handled by ajax), it also handles a lot of payment platforms (Paypal, Paypal Pro, ...), discount codes, quantity limitations, incentives for social sharing, ...

While the plugin is free, there is a lot of paid add-ons giving you access to certain parts (like some paywalls of India and things like that).  

// [Stripe](http://stripe.com) is coming to Belgium, allowing easy online payments and avoiding you the troubles of Ogone and Paypal.
